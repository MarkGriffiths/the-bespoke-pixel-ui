# ‘The Bespoke Pixel’ UI theme for Atom

A soothing, softer and easier-on-the-eye UI theme for long term coding, borrowing from many years of Sublime Edit use and customisation. This is the theme I use for daily Atom use.

Colours are built relativistically using HSL, so it will be possible to adjust the whole interface from a simple setting, along with overall brightness.

Other features:

- Sidebar fades in/out with focus.
- Set up for OS X 10.10 Yosemite and the 'El Capitan' 10.11 Developer Preview.

More to come soon, including a companion syntax package...
