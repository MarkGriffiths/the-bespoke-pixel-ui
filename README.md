# ‘The Bespoke Pixel’ UI theme for Atom

A soothing, softer and easier-on-the-eye UI theme for long coding sessions, borrowing from many years of Sublime Edit use and customisation. This is the theme I use now for daily Atom use.

Based on 'Atom Dark UI', colours are built relativistically using HSL, so it will be possible to adjust the whole interface from a simple setting, along with overall brightness. For now, these can be found in 'styles/hues.less' until I can find an elegant way of providing configurable settings that don't require a restart or an ugly reload.

Other features:

- Sidebar fades in/out with focus.
- Set up for OS X 10.10 Yosemite and the 'El Capitan' 10.11 Developer Preview.

More to come as I find more that I need, or post questions, comments or pull requests on [Github](https://github.com/MarkGriffiths/the-bespoke-pixel-ui/issues).
