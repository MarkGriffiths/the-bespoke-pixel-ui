# The Bespoke Pixel UI

A soothing, softer and easier-on-the-eye UI theme for long term coding, borrowing from many years of Sublime Edit use and customisation. This is the theme I use for daily Atom use.

Colours are built relativistically using HSL, so it will be possible to adjust the whole interface from a simple setting, along with overall brightness.

Other features:

	- Sidebar fades in/out with focus.

More to come soon...
